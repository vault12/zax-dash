# Zax-Dash

Zax-Dash is a simple AngularJS single page app to interact with [Zax Relay](https://github.com/vault12/zax), a [NaCl-based Cryptographic Relay](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/vault12/zax_infogfx.jpg). Zax-Dash uses the [Glow](https://github.com/vault12/glow) library to provide a user-friendly access point to given relay internal mailboxes. We maintain a live [Test Server](https://zax_test.vault12.com) that runs our latest build. For testing purposes expiration of any communication on that relay is set for 30 minutes. You can read the full [technical specification here](http://bit.ly/nacl_relay_spec).

## Dashboard
The default Zax-Dash deployment is included in the Zax repository and can be accessed '/public' (via `/public`). You do not need to clone this repository to have the dashboard functionality included on your Zax server.

## Getting Started

#### NodeJS
In order to build and use Zax-Dash from source, you need to have a relatively recent version of nodeJS installed.

#### Installation
In a terminal, navigate to the directory in which you'd like to install Zax-Dash and type the following:

```Shell
# get the source
git clone git@github.com:vault12/zax-dash.git

# install dependencies
cd zax-dash
npm install

# run the build script
node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js build
```

#### Running Zax
To connect to your relay, first make sure that it is running on `localhost:8080` via `rails s -p 8080`.

Alternatively, you can modify the `relayUrl`  method in `crypto.service.coffee` to use an alternate relay or to use Zax-dash in standalone mode.

To run Zax-Dash locally (outside of a Zax instance) run this command:

```Shell
node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js watch
```
​
Note that if you have [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) installed globally, you can also simply type:
​
```Shell
gulp watch
```
